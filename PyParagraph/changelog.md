# Changelog

## **03/24/2021**
- code in [main.py](main.py)
- added user input, error handler for non-existing files
- added word count, code works but tested against MS-Word word count and there is a disparity
    - The disparity is caused by "enhancer-promoter" MS-Word interprets it as 2 words, which shouldn't. Code works fine
- added, tested and debugged sentence count
